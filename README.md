Samsung stores its clipboard history of 40 items to its clipbord and it's a pain to delete them all at once in case you feel some sensitive items are copied in there.
There is not even an escape from Samsung's syncing them to their system level (you can't disable clipboard by ADB things).

I created this script for myself which will dampen the previous clipboard history by copying randomly newly generated 50 numbers to the clipboard.

Requirements:
1. Termux
2. Termux-api
